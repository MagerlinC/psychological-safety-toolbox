# Addressing the elephant in the room 🐘

It's right there. But no one else seems to bat an eye. Maybe you’re supposed to know? Could you ask? Maybe you should keep quiet and figure it out later...

It’s human instinct to “fit in” and “go along”, but this instinct can work against us when we want to innovate.

Establishing a culture of psychological safety can help your team members feel safe to address the elephant in the room, and get everyone’s brains and voices in the game.

I have designed actionable tools for working with psychological safety based on [research and testing with industry software teams](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-08169-9_6).
