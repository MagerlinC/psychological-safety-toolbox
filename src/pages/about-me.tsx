              I'm a software reveloper by day, and a psychological safety
              practitioner and researcher by... well, also day I suppose. I come
              from a background working as a software developer, but quickly
              experienced that people and their interactions often end up
              shaping the software we build just as much as the technology
              itself. In learning about the worlds of psychological safety and
              Conwayâ€™s law, I was hooked.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a result of this, I have spent the last couple of years working
              with researchers, practitioners and software teams alike, trying
              to find ways to enable software teams to work with psychological
              safety.
            </p>
            <p>
              The result of this has been a research award, various conference
              talks and several amazing experiences working with psychological
              safety in different software teams. I focus on making
              psychological safety <i>actionable</i>, designing and implementing
              tools for working with psychological safety, which your and your
              team can adopt to start working with psychological safety today!
            </p>
            <p>
              I also hold various talks and workshops, sharing the good word
              with those interested in psychological safety. If you want me to
              speak at your event, facilitate a workshop with your company, or
