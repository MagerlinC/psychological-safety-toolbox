Alice starts out, presenting a new filtering feature which she has been working on for a customer\u2019s audio book application. She starts out by presenting the user story she is trying to solve, before showing the feature off in their testing environment. Alice then flips to a slide containing the three questions. She presents that her biggest challenge to overcome was trying to make multiple filters work at the same time, especially because the filters were of many different types. She shows code from a previous attempt at combining filters using some clever boolean logic, but shares that it ultimately became impossible to keep track of when adding new filtering options. She finally tried an inheritance-based solution with separate filter classes, and shows how easy it is to add new filters. Alice shares that her experience has re-inforced the notion that one should always try to consider potential future additions to the feature that you are currently working on, before writing the first line of code.
