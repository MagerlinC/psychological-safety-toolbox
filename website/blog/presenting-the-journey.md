## Use When

The complexity/challenges of your team members’ individual work is not clear to other team members.

## Prerequisites

One or more team members who have completed a non-trivial unit of work, which they can present.

## Tool Description

Teams are commonly asked to present the product of their work. Seldom is the journey that led them to that product shared. This is a missed opportunity for the potential learning which could come from sharing one’s experiments, mistakes and learnings along the way. “Presenting the Journey” aims to alleviate this by including the journey as part of the presentation of the product.
Have one or more team members present their body of work, in a similar fashion to how your team members normally present their work to each other. After presenting their work, have the presenters ask and answer the following questions, as part of the presentation:

1. What was the biggest challenge to overcome in order to complete this unit of work?
2. What solutions did you attempt to implement to overcome that challenge? Which ones worked, which did not?
3. What did you learn that you could find useful for future work?
   Questions from other team members are encouraged!

“Presenting the Journey” can be conducted during an existing presentation of work, such as a Sprint Demo. If multiple team members or sub-teams have work to present, Presenting the Journey can be repeated.

## Purpose

Sharing with whole team experiments, mistakes and learnings that are experienced individually or in sub-groups.

## Outcome

Sharing the learning outcomes of the individual team member’s process encourages a culture of team learning and experimentation. Additionally, the learning outcomes of one team member’s process can aid other team members in their future work when shared.
