# Introduction

Welcome to your toolbox of **tools** for working with psychological safety! This document will contain a small introduction, a guide to using the **tools**, and finally a list of all the **tools** available.

Like most tools, this compendium will not magically grant psychological safety to your team. However, it might help you start a valuable conversation in your team.

## What is Psychological Safety?

Psychological safety is cultural phenomenon which exists in all human interaction. Psychological safety is a belief that one will not be punished or humiliated for speaking up with ideas, questions, concerns, or mistakes within a group. A team with high psychological safety is one wherein the team members feel safe to experiment and learn, to make mistakes, and to speak openly and address the hard questions.
The term was first coined by Amy Edmondson, a Professor of Leadership and Management at Harvard. Her introduction to the subject can be explored by using the very first tool, ‚ÄùLaying the Foundation‚Äù.

## Why Psychological Safety?

Psychological safety has been proven to be one the main predictors of team efficiency in innovative and complex environments. Psychological safety is an enabler of candor, and helps your team speak openly, experiment, and learn from mistakes. However, psychological safety is not about feeling comfortable and never challenging each other.
While the immediate goal of working with psychological safety might consist of learning to open up and ask the difficult questions, the end goal of psychological safety should be excellence, not comfort.

Good psychological safety gets everyone's brains and voices in the game, giving you your highest potential for valuable outcomes of your team's work.

## What is a "Tool"?

In the following pages, a list of **tools** for working with psychological safety will be presented. Your team can pick up these **tools** and use them for working with psychological safety. A tool describes an activity which your team can integrate into your practice, the motivation for performing it, as well as the duration and frequency with which the activity should be performed. Some **tools** are designed to be used daily, while others can be used once per iteration, such as a Sprint or a work week, or individually ad-hoc throughout the iteration.
Finally, each tool lists the intended outcome of using the tool, and provides a few examples. Note that each tool comes with a hexagonal indicator, indicating the required level of comfort with dissent in your team, on a scale from 1-3, to get the most out of the tool. Some of the **tools** will challenge your team, and address the ‚Äúhard‚Äù questions. It‚Äôs important to consider whether or not a ‚Äúharder‚Äù tool will be constructive for your team, based on their existing comfort with dissent. Comfort with dissent is hard to measure, so it is up to your team to assess which **tools** they think are appropriate.

## Why use ools for Psychological Safety?

Psychological safety is nothing new. In fact, most people experience it every day of their work life, perhaps unknowingly. However, very few teams actively discuss it - it's often an invisible phenomenon. This is where **tools** come in. By having your team agree to use a **tool**, you acknowledge the need for discussing this invisble but present phenomenon, and provide your team with a prompt to engage with that discussion.

## Who are the Tools for?

The list of **tools** provdied below is intended for use by teams of 3-10 people, who wish to engage in working towards a more psychologically safe culture within their team. The **tools** are designed to be carried out by one team at a time, but feel free to share your experiences across teams.

For the best outcome, the **tools** selected by your team should be utilized by every person that is considered a member of the team, regardless of position or role within the team.

# Quick Reference

This compendium consists of 8 **tools**, which all outline various ways in which your team can work with psychological safety.

Although any tool can be used by any team, the **tools** differ slightly in design, and some will be a better match for your team than others.

This quick reference sheet will help you get an overview of the **tools**, and help you decide which ones will be best suited for your team.

Note that while some **tools** might mention physical artifacts (such as post-its), all **tools** were designed with online meetings in mind, and any digital replacement will work. In general, adapting a **tool** in ways that make it function better in your context is highly encouraged.

## Reading the Tool Sheets

Each **tool** is presented on a single page, with an example of the **tool** in use on the following page. A **tool** page has 5 main elements, describing how to implement them:

1. a motivation for when to use the **tool**
2. prerequisites (if any)
3. a description of the activity to be performed
4. a purpose statement
5. expected outcome

Additionally, different **tools** vary along four dimensions:

1. Setting (group session/individual)
2. Duration
3. Frequency of use
4. Required comfort with dissent

Use this information to pick a set of **tools** for your team to try, which works in your given context.

## Quick Start

The full list of **tools** will follow on the next page. To get started, pick 2-3 **tools** and try them out in your team.

However, if you are new to working with psychological safety, and want a quick start, the following **tools** are recommended to get you started:

1. [Laying the Foundation](tools/laying-the-foundation.md)
2. [Checking In](tools/checking-in.md)
3. [Acting on Concerns](tools/checking-in.md)

If you want to further deepen your work with psychological safety, feel free to dive into the other **tools**. There is no minimum or maximum amount of **tools** that your team can use at a given time, so feel free to pick the setup that fits your team the best!

And perhaps most importantly; have fun!
